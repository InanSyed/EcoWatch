EcoWatch is a social networking app with a focus on inspiring community oriented environmental activism. Users can join communities to participate in events geared towards helping the environment, chat with other users, share their progress, and compete with others on the EcoPoints leaderboard.

EcoWatch is written in React (using Tailwind and through Vite) with a Firebase backend.
